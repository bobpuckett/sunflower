# Our priorities

- Get up and running in as few steps as possible
- Fully document current features before development of new ones
- Abstract only to the extent that this project can be discarded without discarding the infrastructure
- Provide the value of a monolith (shortest path to production, low infrastructure management cost) with the benefits of a microservices (horizontal scalability, isolated processes).
- Prioritize use cases for small teams
